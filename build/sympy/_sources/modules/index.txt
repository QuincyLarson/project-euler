SymPy Modules Reference
=======================

Because every feature of SymPy must have a test case, when you are not sure how
to use something, just look into the ``tests/`` directories, find that feature
and read the tests for it, that will tell you everything you need to know.

Most of the things are already documented though in this document, that is
automatically generated using SymPy's docstrings.

Click the  "modules" (:ref:`modindex`) link in the top right corner to easily
access any SymPy module, or use this contens:

Contributions to docs
---------------------

All contributions are welcome. If you'd like to improve something, look into
the sources if they contain the information you need (if not, please fix them),
otherwise the documentation generation needs to be improved (look in the
``doc/`` directory).
